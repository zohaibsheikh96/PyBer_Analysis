# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

This analysis has two major objectives. The first objective is to summarize information about the rides according to the type of cities (Rural, Suburban and urban).
The summary is stored in a data frame called "pyber_summary_df". The second objective is to visualize the total amount of fare payed by the customers each month.

## Results:

The image above shows the summary of the ride sharing data. As expected, the highly populated areas (Urban and suburban) have the most number of drivers and the number of rides. It is interesting to see that the per ride fare is high for rural areas. This can be explained by the basic theories of supply and demand. The visualizations below helps in understading the total amount of fare paid in each type of city on monthly basis.

## Summary:

Recommendations to the CEO based on the analysis.


1) Increase the number of drivers in rural areas. The high cost of ride will descourage customers to benefit from our service.

2) Urban areas should have less drivers. This will allow the drivers to make more profit per ride.

3) Discount coupons should be floated on months where number of rides drop. This drop is specially seen in March and April.
